				<h1>Extinct birds</h1>
				<p>Extinct birds refer to bird species that no longer exist and have become extinct due to various reasons such as habitat loss, hunting, and climate change. Some well-known extinct birds include the dodo, passenger pigeon, and Carolina parakeet. The dodo, for example, is a flightless bird that was found on the island of Mauritius and was hunted by humans, leading to its extinction in the 17th century. The passenger pigeon, on the other hand, was once the most abundant bird in North America but was hunted to extinction by the early 20th century. The Carolina parakeet was also hunted for its colorful feathers, and its last known individual died in captivity in 1918. Through the study of extinct birds, scientists can better understand the impact of human activities on wildlife and ecosystems, and work towards preventing further extinctions in the future.</p>

				<h2>Is the dodo an extinct bird?</h2>
				<p>The dodo bird was a flightless bird that was endemic to the island of Mauritius, which is located in the Indian Ocean. The bird was first sighted by Portuguese sailors in the early 16th century and was finally hunted to extinction in the late 17th century. The dodo bird was about 3 feet tall and weighed about 40 pounds. It had a large beak, short wings, and a plump body. The bird had no natural predators on the island, which made it very easy for humans to hunt and kill it. Today, the dodo bird remains an important symbol of extinction and the need for conservation efforts to protect vulnerable species.</p>

				<h2>Elephant bird</h2>
				<p>The elephant bird was a large, flightless bird that lived on the island of Madagascar until it went extinct approximately 1,000 years ago. It was one of the heaviest birds to have ever existed, with some species weighing up to 1,100 pounds and standing up to 10 feet tall. The bird's name comes from its size and the mistaken belief that its eggs were laid by elephants. The elephant bird's extinction is thought to have been caused by a combination of hunting and habitat loss, as well as the introduction of non-native species to Madagascar. Although the elephant bird is now extinct, its fossils and eggs can still be found and studied, offering valuable insights into the ecology of Madagascar during the bird's existence.</p>
